// This lets a user to register as eligible for something, based off
// whether they are holding a certain amount of some token.

// WARNING: Using readContractState with a user supplied contract means
// That contracts code will be loaded and executed in whatever environment

// until contracts are sandboxed. You should only read from contracts you
// have reviewed the code for.

// readContractState will get another contracts state as it was at the same
// block height as the action.
